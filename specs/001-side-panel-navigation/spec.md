# Feature Specification: Side Panel Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `001-side-panel-navigation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we need to enhance the actual UX of the front page of the site. Actually, it's a card list and when we click on a card, it opens the corresponding data ID in a new blank page. But now we need, on click, to open a panel on the left side of the screen without blocking the actual list to allow users to go from card to card and access the data without losing the card list."

**Updated Requirements**: "The item detail panel should be hidden by default and when we click on a card it should slide from right to left taking half of the screen with animation effect without masking the card list. The card list width should just re-adapt responsively."

**Critical Constraint**: "When the panel opens, we need to keep the cards, adapt their container responsively but we don't want to touch at the filter bar on the far left, it must stay as it is without moving or resizing."

## Context & Constraints

**Existing Implementation**:
- Filter bar on the far left (fixed position/width)
- Card list component already exists and is functional
- Item detail page already exists (currently opens in new window/tab)
- Data fetching logic for both list and details already implemented
- API integration already working

**Scope of Work**:
- This is a **refactoring/integration task**, NOT building from scratch
- MUST reuse existing card list component without major rewrites
- MUST reuse existing detail page component/logic
- MUST add side panel that slides from right to left with animation
- Panel takes 50% of screen width when open
- Card list container resizes responsively to accommodate panel (no masking/overlay)
- **CRITICAL**: Filter bar on far left MUST remain fixed (no movement, no resizing)
- Only the card list container between filter bar and panel should resize
- MUST modify card click behavior to open panel instead of new window
- Focus on minimal code changes that integrate existing components

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Follows **Principle VII: Minimalism & Simplicity** - no over-engineering, reuse existing code
- Follows **Principle I: Accessibility First** - improves UX without losing existing functionality
- Follows **Principle V: Performance & Responsiveness** - maintains existing performance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - View Card Details in Side Panel (Priority: P1)

As a user browsing the card list on the front page, I want to click on a card and see its detailed information in a side panel, so that I can explore data without losing my place in the list or opening new tabs.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that solves the main UX problem. Users currently lose context when cards open in new tabs. The side panel keeps the list visible and allows seamless exploration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking any card in the list and verifying that a side panel slides in from the right taking 50% of the screen, while the card list container responsively resizes, and the filter bar on the far left remains completely unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the card list on the front page with the filter bar on the left, **When** I click on any card, **Then** a side panel slides in from the right with a smooth animation showing the card's detailed information
2. **Given** the panel is hidden, **When** I click on a card, **Then** the panel takes exactly 50% of the screen width
3. **Given** the panel opens, **When** the animation completes, **Then** the card list container responsively resizes to accommodate the panel while the filter bar remains unchanged
4. **Given** the panel is opening, **When** I observe the filter bar, **Then** it does not move, resize, or change in any way
5. **Given** I am viewing the card list, **When** the panel is open, **Then** the card list remains visible, scrollable, and interactive in its resized state
6. **Given** the side panel is open with card details, **When** I look at the panel, **Then** I see all relevant data fields displayed in a clear, readable format
7. **Given** the side panel is open, **When** I click outside the panel or on a close button, **Then** the panel slides out to the right and the card list container expands back to its original width
8. **Given** the panel closes, **When** I observe the filter bar, **Then** it remains unchanged throughout the entire animation

### User Story 2 - Navigate Between Cards Without Closing Panel (Priority: P2)

As a user with the side panel open, I want to click on other cards in the list to update the panel content, so that I can quickly compare multiple items without repeatedly opening and closing the panel.

**Why this priority**: This enables efficient exploration and comparison. Users can browse through multiple cards rapidly without the friction of closing and reopening the panel each time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the side panel with one card, then clicking another card in the resized list and verifying the panel updates with the new card's details without closing or resizing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the side panel is open showing Card A's details, **When** I click on Card B in the list, **Then** the panel content updates to show Card B's details without closing or changing size
2. **Given** the side panel is open, **When** I click multiple cards in succession, **Then** the panel smoothly updates with each card's details while maintaining 50% width
3. **Given** the side panel is updating content, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** there is a smooth visual transition (fade) indicating the content change
4. **Given** the card list container is resized, **When** I click different cards, **Then** the container width remains stable and the filter bar stays unchanged

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Indication of Selected Card (Priority: P3)

As a user with the side panel open, I want to see which card is currently displayed in the panel, so that I can maintain context and know which item I'm viewing.

**Why this priority**: This improves usability by providing visual feedback. Users can easily identify which card corresponds to the panel content, especially useful when scrolling through a long list.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the side panel and verifying that the currently selected card has a distinct visual indicator (highlight, border, or background color) that differentiates it from other cards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the side panel is open showing a card's details, **When** I look at the card list, **Then** the corresponding card is visually highlighted or marked
2. **Given** Card A is selected and highlighted, **When** I click Card B, **Then** Card A's highlight is removed and Card B becomes highlighted
3. **Given** the side panel is closed, **When** I view the card list, **Then** no cards are highlighted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user clicks the same card that's already open in the panel?
  - Expected: Panel remains open with the same content (no action or brief visual feedback)
- What happens when the API fails to load card details for the panel?
  - Expected: Panel shows a user-friendly error message with retry option
- What happens when the user resizes the browser window with the panel open?
  - Expected: Panel maintains 50% of screen width, card list container adjusts proportionally, filter bar remains fixed at its original size
- What happens on mobile devices or narrow screens where 50/50 split is not practical?
  - Expected: Panel should adapt (possibly full-screen overlay on mobile, or different breakpoint behavior)
- What happens when the user uses keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)?
  - Expected: Panel is keyboard accessible (Escape closes, Tab navigates within panel)
- What happens when the user clicks the browser back button with the panel open?
  - Expected: Panel closes (or URL reflects panel state if using URL parameters)
- What happens when loading a card with very large amounts of data?
  - Expected: Panel content is scrollable, loads progressively, or shows loading state

### Key Entities

- **Card**: Represents a data item in the list view. Contains an identifier and summary information displayed in the card. When clicked, triggers the side panel to display full details.
- **Card Details**: Complete data record associated with a card. Contains all fields and information from the Data Inclusion API for a specific item. Displayed in the side panel.
- **Panel State**: Tracks whether the side panel is open, which card is currently selected, and the loading/error state of the panel content.

### Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: The existing card list component can accept a click handler prop or event listener modification
- **Assumption 2**: The existing detail page component is modular enough to be rendered within a panel container
- **Assumption 3**: The existing data fetching logic can be reused or called from the panel context
- **Assumption 4**: The current routing for detail pages can be preserved as a fallback (e.g., direct URL access still works)
- **Assumption 5**: The existing card data includes a unique identifier that can be used to fetch details
- **Assumption 6**: The detail page styling is flexible enough to adapt to 50% screen width
- **Assumption 7**: The card list container can responsively resize without breaking layout
- **Assumption 8**: The existing CSS/styling framework supports smooth width transitions for responsive resizing
- **Assumption 9**: The filter bar has a fixed width or is positioned independently from the card list container
- **Assumption 10**: The layout uses a flexible container system (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox) that allows the card list to resize while keeping the filter bar fixed
